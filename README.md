# First-steps
javascript contribution for a website

This repository is part of a course I took
on javascript language and DOM manipulation.
The project started by forking a repository
with HTML and CSS code, I added a script.js
file to add some interactivity to the website
and created an index.html file to merge some 
of the components that were created in the
repository to achieve a final view where the
navbar works with all its menus.
