# Yard Sale 🛒
---
This project was made during the JavaScript Practical Course from Platzi

🌐 Deploy available here: [YardSale](https://canti21.github.io/yardsale/)

### Objective 🎯

Merge together some already made components in a single page to make a trading website.

The challenge here was to give dynamism to the page using JavaScript and CSS, hidding and showing menus and other info according to user inputs. Also added small details to improve accessibility, like changing the media queries a little and adding small contrast details.

### Results 📈

The page ended up looking like this:

### The Plan 📝

I'd like to keep improving the page, adding features and even other pages. If I do so I'll be posting the upgrades here.
