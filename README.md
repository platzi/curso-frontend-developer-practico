# Simple Shopping Page with JS

The index page integrates the individual components of the main view through the implementation of a single HTML and CSS file and the addition of JavaScript to create interaction.

Files/components merged:
- clase11.html (general menu)
- clase7.html (desktop menu)
- clase8.html (mobile menu)
- clase13.html (shopping cart)
- clase6.html (product list)
- clase12.html (product detail)

The page is deployed at: https://manuducos.github.io/simple-shopping-page-with-js/

###### Note that the info and images are just ilustrative and don't match with the product info displayed when an item is clicked. However, the render of each item is taken into practice in a similar way to what would be if there was a backend (see main.js).
