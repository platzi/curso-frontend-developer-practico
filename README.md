This project was created during the Javascript Practical Course in Platzi

## Goal

The main purpose for this course was to put in practice all the knowledge learned from the Basic Javascript Course.
We added dynamism to the page using JavaScript and CSS, hiding and showing menus and more info according to user inputs.
 Also added small details to improve accessibility, like creating media queries and adding small contrast details.
