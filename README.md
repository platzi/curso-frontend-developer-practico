## Project Goal
The objective of this proyect was to stitch up severeal html files alongside the css styles. This files were writen by every course studend alongside our Frontend Teacher (@teffcode). Also we have to add interactivity to the page using Vanilla Javascript.

By the end of the course our teacher encourage us to go ahead and improve what ever we feel that can be inmproved. Me personally did the following:

- Add the functionality to fill up the shopping cart list dynamically based on the items picked by the user in the main product grid.
- Enable the feature to dynamically fill the ASIDE product-detail window with info from the dummie data feed that can also be replace with an api feed.
- Did a few tweaks to the site styles to improve a little bit the overall looks.
- Last but not the lease: i take the oportunity to practice with almost all commits using "gitflow" and "Conventional Commits" Guidelines.
